Financial Budget Console App Problem #1


- this first console app allows you to enter in your bi weekly paycheck
and then you enter in the following bills you need to pay

	1. Rent
	2. Car Note
	3. Car Insurance
	4. Internet Bill
	5. Phone Bill 
	6. Groceries


- it then will add those up and give you back the money you have 
for personal spending (discretionary income)

- the problem solved here, is this is an app that can help you figure out
your bi weekly budget and perform all the mathematical equations for you
