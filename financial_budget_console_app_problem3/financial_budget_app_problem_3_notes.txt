Financial Budget Console App Problem #3



========================================
***COSMETIC CHANGES***

- right now we are using the standard .net console to output our data
which displays a black screen with white as the words

- its not very visually appealing, so we will add an enhancemnt that will change the
color of the words to be more cool

- also we MIGHT TRY to add some unicode character art to the opening of the app for fun
========================================



========================================
***FUNCTIONAL CHANGES***

- this is the third upgrade of the first console app

- this will be more of an enhancement to the application, as will we add
a component to the app which will allow you to download your bills (using file streams) and the 
total bi-weekly amount to a file (this kind of like storing or saving your data, BUT NOT EXACTLY)

- the report will allow you to view previous bills and data for personal optional trending
